# 64-bit Operating System Development Plan

> **Progress Update (May 6, 2025)**: Initial development environment, UEFI bootloader, and kernel core successfully implemented and compiled. Currently addressing disk boot issues where QEMU reports "Boot failed: not a bootable disk". Build system and QEMU testing environment established with GAN-inspired dual validation approach.

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a 64-bit operating system from scratch using Rust, C++, C, and assembly language. The OS will be tested using QEMU.

- **Primary Languages**: Rust, C++
- **Secondary Languages**: C, Assembly
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **Testing Environment**: QEMU

## Development Philosophy

Our development approach follows a dual validation system inspired by GAN architecture:
- **Generator Role**: Implement features, propose solutions, analyze requirements
- **Discriminator Role**: Validate implementations, challenge assumptions, identify issues

Each phase will be validated against technical criteria and architectural principles before proceeding.

## Phase 1: Bootloader & Environment Setup (2-3 months)

### 1.1 Bootloader Development

#### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create UEFI-compatible bootloader using Rust and assembly
- [ ] Implement 16-bit to 64-bit mode transition
- [ ] Set up initial paging structure
- [ ] Configure Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
- [ ] Initialize Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
- [ ] Implement basic memory detection

**Generator Role Progress**: Basic UEFI bootloader implemented with proper UEFI service initialization and console output. Bootloader successfully compiles and can be loaded by QEMU.

**Discriminator Role Validation**: Bootloader verified to initialize UEFI environment correctly and handle basic system checks.

#### Validation Criteria
- Bootloader successfully transfers control to kernel
- Clean transition from real mode to protected mode to long mode
- Memory map accurately represents hardware
